I worked with a team of fantastic individuals who became a\n            vital part of my life. As if training cadets, writing policies,\n            meeting with stakeholders, and planning and implementing changes for\n            CSP training wasn't enough, I decided to continue my knowledge and\n            skills by going back to school and earn an advanced degree. Over two\n            years I spent sleepless nights working on research and building\n            projects, but finally, the hard worked paid off and I earned a\n            Master's Degree in Management through the Colorado State University\n            system.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <div className=\"middlePicsDiv\">\n              <img\n                className=\"middlePics\"\n                id=\"recruiter\"\n                src={recruiter}\n                alt=\"recruiter and man talking\"\n              />\n              <img\n                className=\"middlePics\"\n                id=\"schoolShooting\"\n                src={schoolShooting}\n                alt=\"police officers\"\n              />\n            </div>\n            After successfully completing the accreditation and assisting with\n            CSP's Tri-Arc Accreditation, which I believe was the second state\n            agency in the country to receive such accolades, I was asked to take\n            on the role of CSP's Registrar. In this position, I oversaw the\n            training requirements and records for all CSP members. I implimented\n            an online registration and hub for continuing education, with the\n            help of several members, moved CSP from paper records to digital. As\n            a team, my group digitized training records back to 1989. This was a\n            huge benefit to members, administration, and outside stakeholders,\n            as our records were more complete, more accurate, and tremendous\n            time was saved with producing requested records.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            After a few years serving in that role, I decided to go back into\n            the field. For a short time I was a trooper again in the metro\n            region, before I was selected as a Sergeant in the Colorado Springs\n            area. I led a team of highly motivated and wonderfully personable\n            individuals. We had many exciting and scary experiences, from foot\n            chases, to armed individuals, to pursuits, shootings, standoffs, and\n            just about everything a young police officer would hope to\n            experience in a long career.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            In 2021, I decided after long-consideration to start a new life\n            outside of law enforcement. I took with me years of experience and\n            life-long friendships. A part of this consideration was my love for\n            technology and how it benefits the world. I have always been the\n            \"tech guy\" in my group of friends and have been \"that guy\" with the\n            latest gadets. I have always loved to read and learn about the next\n            best thing in technology.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            My love of IOT led me to researching software engineering programs.\n            After lot of research, I decided to apply for General Assembly's\n            Software Engineering emmersive, as it was highly reviewed and fit\n            the schedule I was looking for. I spoke with Harrison with GA and\n            was blown away by his professionalism and customer service. The\n            program was intense and without taking a break nor looking back, I\n            jumped both feet into the program.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Over the next 13 weeks, I spent 12-13 hour days coding and designing\n            and editing and deleting and coding some more. Did I say the program\n            was intense? It was, but it was the only way for me to learn. I\n            loved the pressure. Thoughout the program I had a great team of\n            staff and students to help me through it all.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Throughout GA's program I learned both frontend and backend\n            languages. I learned basics in computer science and got to dive deep\n            into algoryths. I produced a portfolio, which I am proud of and\n            itching to continue progress on. The languages I learned will\n            certainly help me in my future quest to become a great software\n            engineer.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            With all of that being said, I am eager and hopeful to start my next\n            career with a great company. If your team is looking for a dedicated\n            team member, please reach out to me. I'm excited to meet new people,\n            dive into progressive projects, and be a cog in new better tomorrow.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Thanks, Dave\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"container2\">\n        <img className=\"bottomPics\" id=\"hiker\" src={hiker} alt=\"hiker\" />\n        <img\n          className=\"bottomPics\"\n          id=\"familyHiking\"\n          src={familyHiking}\n          alt=\"family hiking\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MeetDave;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
