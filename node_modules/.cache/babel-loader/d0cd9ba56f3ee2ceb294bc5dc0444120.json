I took with me years of experience and life-long friendships.  A part of this consideration was my love for technology and how it benefits the world.  I have always been the \"tech guy\" in my group of friends.  I've been the guy with the latest gadet and continue to read about the \"next best thing\" in technology.\n                      <br />\n                      <br />\n                      My love of IOT led me to researching software engineering programs.  After  lot of research, I decided to apply for General Assembly's Software Engineering emmersive, as it was highly reviewed and fit the schedule I was looking for.  I spoke with Harrison with GA and was blown away by his professionalism and customer service.  The program was intense and without taking a break nor looking back, I jumped both feet into the program.  \n                      <br />\n                      <br />                      \n                      Over the next 13 weeks, I spent 12-13 hour days coding and designing and editing and deleting and coding some more.  Did I say the program was intense?  It was, but it was the only way for me to learn.  I loved the pressure.  Thoughout the program I had a great team of staff and students to help me through it all.\n                      <br />\n                      <br />\n                      Throughout GA's program I learned both frontend and backend languages.  I learned basics in computer science and got to dive deep into algoryths.  I produced a portfolio, which I am proud of and eager to continue progress on.  The languages I learned will certainly help me in my future quest to become a great software engineer.\n                      <br />\n                      <br />\n                      With all of that being sad I am eager and ex                            \n\n\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div className=\"pic1to3Div\">\n                    <img id=\"fam1\" src={fam1} alt=\"family photo\" />\n                    <img id=\"riot1\" src={riot1} alt=\"riot cops\" />\n                    <img id=\"becAndDogs\" src={becAndDogs} alt=\"man and women with dogs\" />\n                </div>\n          </div>\n          \n          <div className=\"container2\">\n                <div className=\"allOtherPics\">\n                    <img id=\"recruiter\" src={recruiter} alt=\"recruiter and man talking\" />\n                    <img id=\"schoolShooting\" src={schoolShooting} alt=\"police officers\" />\n                    <img id=\"hiker\" src={hiker} alt=\"hiker\" width=\"50%\" />\n                    <img id=\"familyHiking\" src={familyHiking} alt=\"family hiking\" width=\"50%\" />\n                </div>\n                \n                {/* <Footer /> */}\n          </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default MeetDave;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
