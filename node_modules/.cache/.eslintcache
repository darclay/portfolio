site and learning a little bit more about me.  My name is Dave and I live in Colorado, between the two largest cities in Colorado, Denver and Colorado Springs.  I am a native and have lived in almost ever corner of the state.  I was born in a little town on the southern border, Trinindad, but only spent a short part of my life there.  I grew up mostly in the Southeast Corner near Lamar and graduated highschool in McClave.\n                      <br/>\n                      Like most 18 year old kids, I had no idea what I wanted to do.  I watched a lot of kungfu movies as a kid and secretly wanted to be a ninja when I grew up.  Nobody told me that wasn't a real thing. :)  I lasted a semester in college and then went into the real world.  Very quickly, I met my wife, had a child, and the reality of the world set in.  I had to get an education and support a family.  I went back to school, concentrated on criminal justice and received a Bachelor's Degree with honors in Sociology.  I quickly got a job with the Colorado Department of Corrections and later with the Colorado State Patrol.  \n                      <br/>\n                      For the last 15 years I dedicated my life to protecting the citizens of Colorado while serving with the Colorado State Patrol (CSP).  I started in the southwest corner of Colorado and later moved to the front range.  I was a road trooper in both rural and metro areas.  During my career, I served as a public information officer, a field training officer, a super-user for technology, and a trainer.  I was also trained as a Crisis Intervention Officer and as a Level IV Accident reconstructionist, which entailed an understanding and application of physics' concepts.  \n                      <br/>\n                      With about eight years in my career, I interviewed and was selected for the North Colorado Recruiter Position.  For CSP, I implemented the first online connections with potential recruits, using sites like LinkedIn and Monster.  Shortly thereafter, I was asked to assist with CSP's implementation of CALEA accrediation for their training branch.  I worked with a team of fantastic individuals who became life-long friends.  As if training cadets, writing policies, meeting with stakeholders, and planning and implementing changes for CSP training wasn't enough, I decided to advance my knowledge and skills and take on an advanced degree in management.  Over two years I spent sleepless nights working on rearch and building projects, but finally earned a Master's Degree in Management through the Colorado State University System.  \n                      <b/>\n                      After successfully completing the accreditation and assisting with CSP's Tri-Arc Accreditation, which I believe was the second state agency in the country to receive such accolades, I was asked to take on the role of CSP's Registrar.  I this position, I oversaw the training requirements and records for all CSP members.  I implimented an online registration and hub for continuing education, with the help of several members, moved CSP from paper records to digital.  As a team my section digitized training records back to 1989.  This was a huge benefit to members, administration, and outside stakeholders, as our records were more complete, more accurate, and tremendous time was saved with producing requested records.  \n                      <b/>\n                      After a few years serving in that role, I decided to go back into the field.  For a short time I was a trooper again in the metro region, before I was selected as a Sergeant in the Colorado Springs area.  I led a team of highly motivated and wonderfully personable individuals.  We had many exciting and scary experiences, from foot chases, to armed individuals, to pursuits, shootings, standoffs, and just about everything a young police officer would hope to experience in a long career.  \n                      <br/>\n                      In 2021, I decided after long-consideration to start a new life outside of law enforcement.  I took with me years of experience with            \n\n\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div className=\"pic1to3Div\">\n                    <img id=\"fam1\"
