    <p className=\"daveBioPara\">\n            Good Day and thank you for visiting my site and learning a little\n            bit more about me. My name is Dave and I live between the two\n            largest cities in Colorado, Denver and Colorado Springs. I am a\n            native and have lived in almost ever corner of the state. I was born\n            in a little town on the southern border, Trinindad, but only spent a\n            short part of my life there. I grew up mostly in the Southeast\n            Corner near Lamar and graduated highschool in McClave.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Like most 18 year old kids, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I\n            watched a lot of kungfu movies as a kid and secretly wanted to be a\n            ninja when I grew up. Nobody told me that wasn't a real thing. I\n            lasted a semester in college and then went into the real world. Very\n            quickly, I met my wife, had a child, and the reality of the world\n            set in. I had to get an education and support a family. I went back\n            to school, concentrated on criminal justice and received a\n            Bachelor's Degree with honors in Sociology. I quickly got a job with\n            the Colorado Department of Corrections and later with the Colorado\n            State Patrol.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            For the last 15 years I dedicated my life to protecting the citizens\n            of Colorado while serving with the Colorado State Patrol (CSP). I\n            started in the southwest corner of Colorado and later moved to the\n            front range. I was a road trooper in both rural and metro areas.\n            During my career, I served as a public information officer, a field\n            training officer, a super-user for technology, and a trainer. I was\n            also trained as a Crisis Intervention Officer and as a Level IV\n            Accident reconstructionist, which entailed an understanding and\n            application of physics' concepts.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            During my eighth year with CSP, I interviewed and was selected for\n            the Northern Colorado Recruiter Position. For CSP, I implemented the\n            first online connections with potential recruits, using sites like\n            LinkedIn and Monster. Shortly thereafter, I was asked to assist with\n            CSP's implementation of CALEA accrediation for their training\n            branch. I worked with a team of fantastic individuals who became a\n            vital part of my life. As if training cadets, writing policies,\n            meeting with stakeholders, and planning and implementing changes for\n            CSP training wasn't enough, I decided to continue my knowledge and\n            skills by going back to school and earn an advanced degree. Over two\n            years I spent sleepless nights working on research and building\n            projects, but finally, the hard worked paid off and I earned a\n            Master's Degree in Management through the Colorado State University\n            system.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <div className=\"middlePicsDiv\">\n              <img\n                className=\"middlePics\"\n                id=\"recruiter\"\n                src={recruiter}\n                alt=\"recruiter and man talking\"\n              />\n              <img\n                className=\"middlePics\"\n                id=\"schoolShooting\"\n                src={schoolShooting}\n                alt=\"police officers\"\n              />\n            </div>\n            After successfully completing the accreditation and assisting with\n            CSP's Tri-Arc Accreditation, which I believe was the second state\n            agency in the country to receive such accolades, I was asked to take\n            on the role of CSP's Registrar. In this position, I oversaw the\n            training requirements and records for all CSP members. I implimented\n            an online registration and hub for continuing education, with the\n            help of several members, moved CSP from paper records to digital. As\n            a team, my group digitized training records back to 1989. This was a\n            huge benefit to members, administration, and outside stakeholders,\n            as our records were more complete, more accurate, and tremendous\n            time was saved with producing requested records.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            After a few years serving in that role, I decided to go back into\n            the field. For a short time I was a trooper again in the metro\n            region, before I was selected as a Sergeant in the Colorado Springs\n            area. I led a team of highly motivated and wonderfully personable\n            individuals. We had many exciting and scary experiences, from foot\n            chases, to armed individuals, to pursuits, shootings, standoffs, and\n            just about everything a young police officer would hope to\n            experience in a long career.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            In 2021, I decided after long-consideration to start a new life\n            outside of law enforcement. I took with me years of experience and\n            life-long friendships. A part of this consideration was my love for\n            technology and how it benefits the world. I have always been the\n            \"tech guy\" in my group of friends and have been \"that guy\" with the\n            latest gadets. I have always loved to read and learn about the next\n            best thing in technology.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            My love of IOT led me to researching software engineering programs.\n            After lot of research, I decided to apply for General Assembly's\n            Software Engineering emmersive, as it was highly reviewed and fit\n            the schedule I was looking for. I spoke with Harrison with GA and\n            was blown away by his professionalism and customer service. The\n            program was intense and without taking a break nor looking back, I\n            jumped both feet into the program.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Over the next 13 weeks, I spent 12-13 hour days coding and designing\n            and editing and deleting and coding some more. Did I say the program\n            was intense? It was, but it was the only way for me to learn. I\n            loved the pressure. Thoughout the program I had a great team of\n            staff and students to help me through it all.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Throughout GA's program I learned both frontend and backend\n            languages. I learned basics in computer science and got to dive deep\n            into algoryths. I produced a portfolio, which I am proud of and\n            itching to continue progress on. The languages I learned will\n            certainly help me in my future quest to become a great software\n            engineer.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            With all of that being said, I am eager and hopeful to start my next\n            career with a great company. If your team is looking for a dedicated\n            team member, please reach out to me. I'm excited to meet new people,\n            dive into progressive projects, and be a cog in new better tomorrow.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Thanks, Dave\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"container2\">\n        <img className=\"bottomPics\" id=\"hiker\" src={hiker} alt=\"hiker\" />\n        <img\n          className=\"bottomPics\"\n          id=\"familyHiking\"\n          src={familyHiking}\n          alt=\"family hiking\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MeetDave;\n","/home/blade/Desktop/1_dev/WEEK-FINAL-PORTFOLIO/portfolio/src/screens/contact/Contact.jsx",["66","67"],"import \"./Contact.css\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport NavBar from \"../../components/navigation/NavBar.jsx\";\nimport Footer from \"../../components/footer/Footer.jsx\";\n\nconst Contact = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"contactDiv\">\n      <NavBar />\n      <h3 className=\"contactDavidEmail\">davidgurulejr@gmail.com</h3>\n      <hr className=\"separator3\" />\n      <div className=\"forms\">\n        <iframe\n          src=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScU44xptFY097OX7BNt62SaQru-8DgzzbxQuNkDkt-c7bF04w/viewform?embedded=true\"\n          width=\"80%\"\n          height=\"1000px\"\n          frameborder=\"0\"\n          marginheight=\"0\"\n          marginwidth=\"0\"\n        >\n          Loading…\n        </iframe>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"bottomBackHome\"></div>\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Contact;\n","/home/blade/Desktop/1_dev/WEEK-FINAL-PORTFOLIO/portfolio/src/screens/resume/Resume.jsx",["68","69","70"],"import './Resume.css';\nimport NavBar from '../../components/navigation/NavBar.jsx'\nimport Footer from '../../components/footer/Footer.jsx'\n\n\n\nconst Resume = () => {\n\n  const handleDownload = () => {\n    console.log(\"button clicked\");\n  }\n\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"resumeDiv\">\n        <NavBar />\n        \n        <h2 className=\"resumeTitle\">Resume</h2>\n        <div className=\"buttonDiv\">\n          <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1llpNp8NaOqMdIBOSE8nFednW3Aja5hv4/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">\n              <button className=\"downloadButton\" onClick={handleDownload}>DOWNLOAD</button>\n          </a> \n        </div>\n        \n        <section className=\"section1\">\n            <a href=\"mailto:davidgurulejr@gmail.com\" id=\"email\">DAVIDGURULEJR@GMAIL.COM</a>\n            <a href=\"\">COLORADO SPRINGS, CO 80921</a>\n            <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gurule-865624212/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"linked\">LINKEDIN</a>\n        </section>\n{/* ============================== NAME AND TITLE ================================================== */}\n        <section className=\"section2\">\n            <h2 className=\"davidNameTitle\">DAVID BARCLAY GURULE JR</h2>\n            <p>WEB DEVEOPER   |   SOFTWARE ENGINEER   |   FULL-STACK</p>\n{/* ============================== SKILLS TRAINING FAMILIARITY ===================================== */}\n            <p className=\"bold\">SKILLS, TRAINING, AND FAMILIARITY</p>\n            <hr />\n            <p>JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Postman, REACT, Bootstrap, Google Products, AirTable, Microsoft Sharepoint, Adobe Products, MongoDB, Linux, Windows, Android</p>\n{/* ============================== WHO AM I ======================================================== */}\n            <p className=\"bold\">WHO AM I?</p>\n            <hr />  \n            <p>I have combined the experience I gained in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive with the skills I developed while earning my Masters in Management from Colorado State University to envision ways of developing solutions that can genuinely improve the lives of individuals and teams.
